Turining Machine was the first model of computation by allen turing. It halts in two accept aor reject state.
His idea of any vomputation with the help of turining machine was based on the thinking that any kind of operation
that can be done on pen and paper can be assumed to be performed on a grid.He agued that two dimensional frid is just a convinience.
So he brougth this idea down to one dimensional grid.Every thing is read one at a time and the machine can move either left or right in the tape.
ie the read/write head.(7 tuples)
Finite set of states
input alphabets
tape symbols(read/write head)
transition logic
start state
reject state
accept state
MultiTape Machine can be used to simulate RAM
